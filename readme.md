## ✨ Overview

s-lockedmechanics is a powerful resource management tool designed for JG Mechanic, enabling server owners to create a balanced mechanic system that restricts access based on player classes and vehicle types.

**Why s-lockedmechanics?**

This project streamlines vehicle mechanic interactions while ensuring fair access and enhancing the overall gameplay experience. The core features include:

- 🚗 **Access Control:** Restricts mechanic services based on player classes and vehicle types, ensuring fair gameplay.
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Framework Loading:** Adapts to server states, enhancing performance and user experience.
- ⏳ **Cooldown Management:** Implements cooldowns for mechanic services, preventing abuse and maintaining balance.
- 📢 **Notification System:** Provides real-time feedback to players, improving interaction with mechanic services.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Configuration:** Allows developers to tailor settings for vehicle models, interaction distances, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- **Library:** ox_lib
- **Resource:** JG-Mechanic

### ⚙️ Installation

Build s-lockedmechanics from the source and intsall dependencies:

1. **Install the release:**

2. **Drag Into resources:**

3. **Install the dependencies:**

**[ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib)**
**[jg-mechanic](https://jgscripts.com/scripts/mechanic)

### 💻 Usage

Run the resource by;
Placing the resource in your 'resources' folder,
ensuring the resource.

## 🛠️ Configuration

Ensure that the Config.MechID and Config.MechLabel are the same as the mechanic ID and label in your JG resource, you can place the vector3 in **JG MECHANIC** anywhere you wish. e.g:

https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/iI3kRqnZD1ze.png

MechID and MechLabel in this example would be mygang.
